# LeagueAutoAcceptCompiled
LeagueAutoAccept, but everything is compiled into standalone exe files and is ready to be used.

HOW TO USE

1. Run the SettingsForm2.exe and set the resolution you have on your league of legends client, click apply and close.
2. Open your game and go into queue.
3. Run AutoAcceptLeague.exe and go afk.

OBS: this program might not work if your client is positioned on your secondary monitor, but idk since i havent tried it.
